# Types of Data

# Numerical
# Quantifiable
# Discrete Values and Continous Data

# Categorical
# No inherent mathematical meaning
# Gender, yes/no, race, state of residence, political party
# numbers have no mathematical relationship

# Ordinal
# A mixture of Numerical and Categorical
# So movie ratings
# measure of quality

# Review
# Mean, Median, Mode

# The Median is less susceptible to outliers
# Mode is most common value, only works for discrete values

# Standard Deviation & Variance

# Two fundamental qualities for the spread and shape of data
#The shape of a histogram can tell you a lot about the distribution

# Variance is simply the average of the squared differences from the mean

# Example what is the variance of the data set (1,4,5,4,8)?
# First find the mean (1+4+5+4+8)/5 = 4.4
# Now the differene (-3.4, -0.4, 0.6, -0.4, 3.6)
# Square them (11.56,0.16,0.36,0.16,12.96)
# sigma = (11.56,0.16,0.36,0.16,12.96)/5 = 5.04
