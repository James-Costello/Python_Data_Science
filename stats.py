# Types of Data

# Numerical
# Quantifiable
# Discrete Values and Continous Data

# Categorical
# No inherent mathematical meaning
# Gender, yes/no, race, state of residence, political party
# numbers have no mathematical relationship

# Ordinal
# A mixture of Numerical and Categorical
# So movie ratings
# measure of quality

# Review
# Mean, Median, Mode

# The Median is less susceptible to outliers
# Mode is most common value, only works for discrete values

# Standard Deviation & Variance

# Two fundamental qualities for the spread and shape of data
#The shape of a histogram can tell you a lot about the distribution

# Variance is simply the average of the squared differences from the mean

# Example what is the variance of the data set (1,4,5,4,8)?
# First find the mean (1+4+5+4+8)/5 = 4.4
# Now the differene (-3.4, -0.4, 0.6, -0.4, 3.6)
# Square them (11.56,0.16,0.36,0.16,12.96)
# sigma = (11.56,0.16,0.36,0.16,12.96)/5 = 5.04

# Standard Deviation is sigma, the square root of the variance
# σ^2 = 5.04
# σ = 2.24

# Population Variance vs Sample Variance

# Population Variance = (∑numof data points - mean)^2/(n)
# Sample Variance = (∑numof data points - mean)^2/(n-1)

# Probability Density Function = Continuous Data
# Probability Mass Function = Discrete Data

# Percentiles and Moments
 # 1st moment = mean
 # 2nd moment = variance
 # 3rd moment = skew
 # 4th moment = kurtosis

#matplotlib

# Covariance % correlation

# Conditional Probability

# The Probability of B given A
# P(B|A) = P(B,A)/P(A)

# P(B|A) = (0.6)/(0.8) = 75%

#Bayes Theorem
